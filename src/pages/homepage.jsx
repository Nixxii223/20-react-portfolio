                Hello, my name is Nicki Barrett and I am currently studying full stack web development through the University of Utah in partnership with edX. I also hold a Master of Science degree in Speech-Language Pathology and have spent the past ten years working as a feeding therapist in the Newborn ICU. My goal is to merge my love of feeding therapy with my new-found love of technology to create applications that work for therapists, rather than against them.

                Check out my portfolio with projects showcasing my abilities in full stack coding!

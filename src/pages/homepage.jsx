                Hello, my name is Nicki Barrett and I recently completed a certification in full stack web development through the University of Utah in partnership with edX. I also hold a Master of Science degree in Speech-Language Pathology and have spent the past ten years working as a feeding therapist in the Newborn ICU. I have been team lead in several career roles as well as in volunteer groups and excel at project management. I am excited to bring my skills in communication, problem solving, and team leadership to a new career in web development.
